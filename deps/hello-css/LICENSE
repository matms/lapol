The Libre Baskerville font in the fonts directory is distributed under the SIL
Open Font License 1.1. See fonts/LICENSE.

The fleurons in the <hr> element are exports from the Deja-Vu font, which is in
the public domain.

Everything else is in the public domain. I renounce all copyright, and don’t
care what you do with it. Since this is not possible in all legal jurisdictions
I’ve also attached a modified copy of the ISC license which replaces the
attribution clause with the text “without any restrictions”.
